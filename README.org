* We'll have no trouble here.

The culmination of years of [[http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html][yak-shaving]]...

Relying almost entirley on Emacs' wonderful [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], to [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/][literately]] manage cross
platform configuration files.

All in one handy dandy git repo. Fact.

* Installation
** *Warning*

Installing this stuff will overwrite any configuration files you currently have
in place that are part of this repo, encluding your [[file:~/.emacs.d/][Emacs configuration]].

Please inspect the blocks in the files you intend to tangle and back up any
files that will be overwritten by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Extracting-source-code.html][tangling]] them.

/If that doesn't mean anything to you - please don't do anything until you've
read & understood all the documentation here and linked to!/

** Option 1

1) Clone this repo & open this file in Emacs.
2) *BACKUP ANY CONFIGURATION FILES YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT ARE DEFINED IN THIS REPO.*
3) Execute the elisp source code block below using ~C-c C-c~ with your cursor
   in the block:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (load-file
      (car (org-babel-tangle-file
            (concat default-directory "/emacs/site-lisp/my-tangles.org"))))
     (my/tangle-all)
   #+END_SRC

4) Wait for all the appropriate org files to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Extracting-source-code.html][tangle]] (this may take a while...)
5) ...Profit!

** Option 2

1) Clone this repo & cd into this directory.
2) *BACKUP ANY CONFIGURATION FILES YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT ARE DEFINED IN THIS REPO.*
3) Run ~./install.el~, in a terminal, from this directory.
4) Wait for all the appropriate org files to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Extracting-source-code.html][tangle]] (this may take a while...)
5) ...Profit!

** But I only came here for an Emacs config!

Please go [[file:emacs/README.org][here]]. Or execute the code block below in Emacs with ~C-c C-c~:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     (org-babel-load-file (concat default-directory "/emacs/site-lisp/my-tangles.org"))
     (my/tangle-directory (concat default-directory "/emacs/"))
   #+END_SRC

* How does all this work?

I'm using Emacs' amazing [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] as a basic cross platform configuration
management system.

The functions defined in [[file:emacs/site-lisp/my-tangles.org][this]] file, allow automated tangling of the files in
this repository. However, only the files of the operating system you're
currently using and the files in the [[file:emacs/][Emacs]] and [[file:agnostic/][agnostic]] directories will be
tangled when using the [[file:emacs/site-lisp/my-tangles.org::*TANGLE%20ALL][my/tangle-all]] or [[file:emacs/site-lisp/my-tangles.org::*AUTO%20TANGLE][my/auto-tangle]] functions.

Please see the [[file:emacs/README.org][Emacs configuration directory]] for more details on how this is
implemented. Specifically the functions defined in [[file:emacs/site-lisp/my-tangles.org][this file]].

The main functions were inspired by this guy's blog:

[[http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php/2016/10/26/literate-clojure-programming-tangle-all-in-org-mode/][Frederick Giasson's Literate Programming Blog]]

For more information on tangling, please see the following entries in the
org-mode manual:

*** Emacs

The main emacs configuration from which this strange odyssey of [[http://www.mncc.com.my/ossig/lists/general/2003-09/msg00143.html][sexp

I took a look at those nerds, and although a lot of their statements
are fun to read, I am not sure where the fun ends and the fanaticism
begins with many of them… (save-excursion (recursive-save-all)) be

*** *BSD

Configuration files dedicated to the [[Http://www.unixprogram.com/churchofbsd/][Church of BSD]] ([[https://www.openbsd.org/][OpenBSD]] and
[[https://www.netbsd.org/][NetBSD]]), are located [[file:openbsd/README.org][here]] and [[file:netbsd/][here]], respectively.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"One day I was at a restaurant explaining process control to one of my
disciples.  I was mentioning how we have to kill the children (child
processes) if they become unresponsive. Or we can even set an alarm
for the children to kill themselves.

That the parent need to wait (wait3) and acknowledge that the child
has died or else it will become a zombie.  The look of horror the
woman sitting across had was unforgettable.

I tried to explain it was a computer software thing but it was too
late, she fled terrified, probably to call the police or something. I
didn't really want to stick around too long to find out."

Evil proprietary systems are also catered for...

Cupertino's wickedness resides [[file:macos/README.org][here]], whilst Redmond's ghastliness
dwells in [[file:windows/README.org][this]] unspeakable den of inquity.

Your hacking starts... [[file:./linux/stumpwm/README.org][NOW!]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Stumpwm is a "everything-and-the-kitchen-sink WM" or "the emacs of WMs."

StumpWM manages windows the way emacs manages buffers, or the way screen manages
terminals. If you want a flexible, customizable, hackable desktop experience,
look no further.

And finally, those poor agnostic souls, forever lost in OS purgatory,
are to be found [[./agnostic/README.org][here]].

* Will I be able to cope?

Prepare yourself ...

Yes, there are [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#unicorn][unicorns]]. Lots of [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#unicorn][unicorns]] ...

* Will more strangers come Edward?

Calm yourself Tubbs. None shall come.
